# Active-Directory-Project

## Objective

The objective  this (SOC) automation project is to show how to integrate a powerful a suite of open-source tools: Wazuh will serve as the primary host-based security monitoring and endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform, providing real-time alerts and security event data. This data will be ingested by The Hive, which will function as the central, collaborative Security Incident Response Platform. Then Shuffle will be used as an orchestrator that will automate security tasks, or 'playbooks,' triggered by alerts from Wazuh via The Hive. A key deliverable of this automation is the capability to create and send automated emails for high-severity alerts, ensuring immediate, reliable notification of relevant stakeholders without manual intervention, thereby reducing the mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to security incidents.

### Skills Learned 

- Ability to create a logical diagram of data flow using Draw.io.
- .
- Using the command line to configure Wazuh, Elasticsearch, and The Hive.
- Configuration of conf files in Windows.
- Creating custom rules for Wazuh.
- Using Shuffler.io for workflow automation and orchestration.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Draw.io 
- Virtual Box to install Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 Pro, and Ubuntu server VM's.
- Sysmon and Splunk.
- Windows Server Desktop to configure Active Directory.
- Linux to spin up Ubuntu Server.
- Kali and ART to generate Telemetry.
