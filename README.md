# Active-Directory-Project

## Objective

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in building, securing, and monitoring a simulated enterprise network environment. The primary objective is to develop an understanding of defensive and offensive security principles by first designing the network's data flow using tools like Draw.io, and then virtualizing the infrastructure with VirtualBox. This virtual lab will include a Windows Server promoted to an Active Directory Domain Controller for managing users and groups, alongside a dedicated Splunk server configured via the command line to function as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

The project emphasizes security telemetry generation and collection, which involves installing and configuring Sysmon on a target machine to forward event logs to Splunk. Once the monitoring infrastructure is established, the final objective is to simulate a controlled cyber attack, specifically a brute-force attempt using Kali Linux, to generate realistic security events; and then finally to create and observe the telemetry created.

### Skills Learned 

- Ability to create a logical diagram of data flow using Draw.io.
- Installation and configuration of Virtual Machines using VirtualBox.
- Configuration of Splunk server via the command line.
- Sysmon and Splunk configuration on a Target Machine.
- Active Directory setup, Configuration of a windows server and promotion to a Domain Controller.
- Add groups and users to Active Directory.
- Use Kali Linux to create a brute force attack and create Telemetry.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Draw.io 
- Virtual Box to install Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 Pro, and Ubuntu server VM's.
- Sysmon and Splunk.
- Windows Server Desktop to configure Active Directory.
- Linux to spin up Ubuntu Server.
- Kali and to generate Telemetry.
